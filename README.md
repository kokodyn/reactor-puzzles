# reactor-puzzles
Repository dedicated for tricky cases written using project-reactor.
https://github.com/reactor

# Rules

- Every package under com.jantarcode.puzzles.reactor contains:
    - single puzzle
    - single solution
    - unit test for puzzle and solution
- Puzzle is located in the class with name ending on Task for example MyTask.java.
- Solution is located in the class with name ending on Solution for example MySolution.java.

The user's mission is to correct the .*Task.java class to make passing tests tagged "task".

# GOOD LUCK!
